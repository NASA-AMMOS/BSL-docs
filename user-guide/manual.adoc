[glossary]
Bundle Protocol (BP)::
The overlay network protocol used to transport BPSec blocks and target blocks between nodes.
Bundle Protocol Security (BPSec)::
The mandatory-to-implement security mechanism to protect blocks of a BP bundle.
This is the principal scope of behavior implemented in the BSL.
BP Agent (BPA)::
The instantiation of a BP node with a unique administrative Endpoint ID.
BP Endpoint::
The source or destination of a BP bundle, identified by a BP Endpoint ID (EID).
BP Endpoint ID (EID)::
The identifier of a BP Endpoint; names the source and destination for a BP bundle.
Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)::
The data format used to encode BP Bundles.
Convergence-layer Adapter (CLA)::
CLAs send and receive BP bundles on behalf of the BPA.
Host::
A single node on the network and a single instance of an operating system.
One host can have many interfaces and many IP addresses, but only one canonical host name.
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)::

== Application Programming Interface

The following section provides an overview of the BSL API and references to specific sections of the online API documentation.

=== Introduction

The BSL as a whole is separated into two primary layers of implementation: an API-centric abstract Frontend library and a host-binding concrete Backend library.

The Frontend library provides the service API for the BSL to be called by its associated BPA as needed and for stable public APIs used by Policy Provider implementations and Security Context implementations. The Backend library implements forward-declared structs and functions from the Frontend using specific concrete data containers, algorithms, etc.

Most interactions with the BSL/frontend API occur within the context of a single bundle. There are four points along bundle traversal where BSL interaction from the BPA is necessary:

1. After bundle creation from an application source (APPIN).
2. Before bundle delivery to an application destination (APPOUT).
3. After bundle reception via a CLA (CLIN).
4. Before bundle forwarding via a CLA (CLOUT).

=== Policy Providers (PP)
PPs should be registered with the library context. PPs must implement the function headers of the frontend `PolicyProvider.h` header file. The BSL includes a simple rule-based example PP that may be utilized.

PPs must inspect each bundle to product a set of security operations (SecOps), and finalize over a bundle after each SecOp has been executed by the security context.

=== Security Contexts (SC)
SCs should be registered with the library context. SCs must implement the function headers of the frontend `SecurityContext.h` header file. The BSL includes two Default SC implementations (specified in RFC9173), `BIB-HMAC-SHA2` (Bundle Integrity) and `BCB-AES-GCM` (Bundle Confidentiality) that may be utilized. The BSL's backend cryptographic interface utilizes OpenSSL to perform HMAC-signing, encryption, and decryption operations.

SCs operate in the context of a single SecOp over a bundle. SCs must validate SecOps for consistency, and process SecOps on bundles to produce security outcomes.

=== MockBPA
The BSL's MockBPA provides a basic example of BSL implementation. TODO.

== Workflows
A simple BPA that utilizes the example policy provider, default security contexts, and dynamic backend could operate with the following workflow:

=== Initialization of BSL

Steps 1-5 contain BSL initialization instructions to be performed once (per-thread? TODO double check this).

==== 1. Set & Initialize Host Descriptors
The BSL backend relies on host-specific information from the BPA, such as EID registering and encoding information. The function-pointer fields of a `BSL_HostDescriptors_t` struct should be set with host-implemented functions and initialized with with `BSL_HostDescriptors_Set()` in order for successful BSL operation. See the MockBPA for an example (TODO detail).

==== 2. Initialize the Library Context
Each runtime instance of the BSL is isolated for thread safety within a host-specific struct referenced by a `BSL_LibCtx_t` pointer. Each instance should be initialized using `BSL_LibCtx_Init()`.

==== 3. Initialize EIDs
BPAs can register one or more nodes, each of which has a unique endpoint ID (EID). Each EID must be registered with the host using `BSL_HostEID_Init()`.

==== 4. Register Example Policy Provider(s) (PPs) with the Library Context
Register the example PP with the Library Context.

==== 5. Initialize Cryptosuite & Register Default Security Contexts (SCs) with the Library Context
Initialize the backend crypto interface with `BSL_CryptoInit()`. Then, register the `BIB-HMAC-SHA2` and `BCB-AES-GCM` Default SCs with the Library Context.

=== Single-Bundle Workflow

Steps 6-11 should be performed per-bundle being processed.

==== 6. Initialize Bundle Context for each Bundle
For each bundle being processed by BPA at one of the four points of interaction (APPIN, APPOUT, CLIN, CLOUT), initialize a bundle context. The bundle context will be used throughout the bundle's interaction with the BSL through the host-specific struct `BSL_BundleCtx_t`.

==== 7. Inspect Bundles with PP(s)
Utilize the example PP's inspection function to create an Action Set that contains Security Operations (SecOps).

==== 8. Validate SecOps with SCs
For each SecOp contained within the Action Set, utilize the validate function from the relevant Default SC to ensure validity and feasibility of the operation.

==== 9. Execute SecOps with SCs
For each SecOp contained within the Action Set, utilize the execute function from the relevant Default SC to actually perform each operation on the bundle. The SC will produce Security Outcomes which be returned to the BPA.

==== 10. Finalize Bundles with PP(s)
Utilize the example PP's finalize function to verify successful security operations, bundle consistency, etc. (TODO fill out "etc.")

==== 11. Free Bundle Context
The bundle has now completed the required BSL interactions, and the bundle context resources can be released. The bundle can now be forwarded within the BPA.

=== De-initialization of BSL

==== 12. Free Library Context if BSL no longer needed
Each `BSL_LibCtx_t` instance should be de-initialized using `BSL_LibCtx_Deinit()`.

== Product Support

There are two levels of support for the BSL: troubleshooting by a system administrator, which is detailed in <<sec-troubleshooting>>, and upstream support via the BSL public GitHub project, accessible as described in <<sec-contact>>.
Attempts to troubleshoot should be made before submitting issue tickets to the upstream project.

[#sec-troubleshooting]
=== Troubleshooting

TBD


[#sec-contact]
=== Contacting or Contributing

The BSL is hosted on a GitHub repository <<bsl-source>> with submodule references to several other repositories.
There is a https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/anms/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md[`CONTRIBUTING.md`] document in the BSL repository which describes detailed procedures for submitting tickets to identify defects and suggest enhancements.

Separate from the source for the BSL proper, the BSL Product Guide and User Guide are hosted on a GitHub repository <<bsl-docs>>, with its own https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/anms-docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md[`CONTRIBUTING.md`] document for submitting tickets about either the Product Guide or User Guide.

While the GitHub repositories are the primary means by which users should submit detailed tickets, other inquiries can be made directly via email to the the support address mailto:dtnma-support@jhuapl.edu[,BSL Support].
