[glossary]
Bundle Protocol (BP)::
The overlay network protocol used to transport BPSec blocks and target blocks between nodes.
Bundle Protocol Security (BPSec)::
The mandatory-to-implement security mechanism to protect blocks of a BP bundle.
This is the principal scope of behavior implemented in the BSL.
BP Agent (BPA)::
The instantiation of a BP node with a unique administrative Endpoint ID.
BP Endpoint::
The source or destination of a BP bundle, identified by a BP Endpoint ID (EID).
BP Endpoint ID (EID)::
The identifier of a BP Endpoint; names the source and destination for a BP bundle.
Host::
A single node on the network and a single instance of an operating system.
One host can have many interfaces and many IP addresses, but only one canonical host name.
Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)::
TBD
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)::

[#sec-arch]
== BSL Architecture

The BSL is purposefully designed to be a software library independent of any specific Bundle Protocol Agent (BPA) implementation and runtime environment.
It is intended to be linked to and used by a BPA during runtime to process BPSec security blocks according to local security policy.

The location of the BSL as a subsystem within a BP Node, operated by a BPA is shown in <<fig-bsl-system-context>>.
The interactions between the BSL and BPA are twofold: calls into the BSL to provide its security services, and calls from BSL into the BPA to provide agent, bundle, and block data and metadata.

Additionally, BSL security services are needed at four distinct points during bundle processing procedures within the BPA.
These are depicted in <<fig-bsl-interaction-points>> and correspond to the following 

* After bundle creation from an application source, augmenting the Transmission procedure of <<RFC9171>>.
* Before bundle delivery to an application destination, augmenting the Delivery procedure of <<RFC9171>>.
* After bundle reception via a CLA, augmenting the Reception procedure of <<RFC9171>>.
* Before bundle forwarding via a CLA, augmenting the Forwarding procedure of <<RFC9171>>.

[#sec-arch-components]
=== BSL Components

The BSL source is separated into several different components, each of which is explained in detail in the inline API Documentation <<bsl-main-api>>.
A summary of the components is below.

BSL Frontend::
A C99 library used by a BPA integration and used by each Policy Provider and Security Context to access BSL and BPA behavior and data.
This is the base of the BSL and is intended to be common for all deployments.
Dynamic Backend::
An implementation of the frontend suitable for general-purpose, non-constrained deployments which uses heap-allocated, dynamically-sized data structures and runtime registration of policy providers and security contexts.
This component can be replaced by a deployment-specific alternative if needed.
Example Policy Provider::

Default Security Contexts::
Implementations of the two Default Security Contexts (Context ID 1 and 2) from <<RFC9173>> using cryptographic functions provided by the OpenSSL library.
Mock BPA::
An executable used to provide a test fixture and example BPA integration.
This Mock BPA does not provide any of the normal processing required of a real BPA by <<RFC9171>>, it is limited to decoding and encoding BPv7 protocol data unit (PDU) byte strings, processing specific BPv7 primary block fields, providing BSL-required integration callbacks, and calling into the BSL for each bundle being processed at each interaction point.

=== Build and Runtime Environments

The basic requirements in the <<bsl-srd>> are that the build environment use a C compiler, with its standard headers and libraries <<C99>>, and include POSIX headers and libraries <<POSIX>>.

The example ION-heritage policy provider distributed with the BSL uses the TBD library for JSON parsing.

The example security contexts distributed with the BSL uses the <<OpenSSL>> library for all cryptographic functions.

The Mock BPA distributed with the BSL uses POSIX UDP/IP sockets for BPv7 PDU transport, both as a test CLA and a test application interface.

[#sec-proc]
== Procedures

This chapter includes specific procedures related to managing an BSL deployment.


[#sec-proc-build]
=== Building

The BSL source is composed of a top-level repository `BSL` <<bsl-source>> and a number of submodule repositories; all of them are required for building the BSL.

. The top-level checkout can be done with:
+
----
git clone --recursive --branch <TAGNAME> https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/BSL.git
----
. Optional: switching to a different tag or branch can be done with the sequence:
+
----
git checkout <TAGNAME>
git submodule update --init --recursive
----
. More TBD


[#sec-proc-install]
=== Installation

TBD


[#sec-proc-upgrade]
=== Upgrading

Because the BSL is deployed in an RPM package form, the normal operating system tools and procedures for dealing with software library upgrading apply to the BSL.
The BSL provides SOVERSION information in its libraries, so RPM management tools such as DNF which are cross-dependence-aware will ensure that the correct needed SOVERISON of the BSL is isntalled.

Individual BSL releases may identify pre-upgrade or post-upgrade steps in their specific Release Description Document (RDD) which would agument this OS-standard procedure.


=== Monitoring

The BSL itself, as a software library, does not directly make use of any logging mechanism.

TBD


[#sec-proc-mon-selinux]
==== SELinux Audit Events

The procedures in this section are a summary of more detail provided in Chapter 5 of the RedHat <<rhel9-selinux>> document.

By default, the `setroubleshootd` service is running, which intercepts SELinux audit events

To observe the system audit log in a formatted way run:
----
sudo sealert -l '*'
----

Some SELinux denials are marked as "don't audit" which suppresses normal audit logging when they occur.
They are often associated with network access requests which would flood an audit log if they happen often and repeatedly.
To enable logging of `dontaudit` events run:
----
sudo semanage dontaudit off
----


[#sec-checkout]
=== Checkout Procedures

The BSL packaging procedure includes built unit tests within the `bsl-test` RPM package which allows executing unit tests on the BSL library after build time on any other host.

TBD


[#sec-support]
== Product Support

There are two levels of support for the BSL: troubleshooting by a system administrator, which is detailed in <<sec-troubleshooting>>, and upstream support via the BSL public GitHub project, accessible as described in <<sec-contact>>.
Attempts to troubleshoot should be made before submitting issue tickets to the upstream project.

[#sec-troubleshooting]
=== Troubleshooting

==== Installation

This section covers issues that can occur during installation (see <<sec-proc-install>>) of the BSL.

TBD

==== Operations

This section covers issues that can occur after successful installation (see <<sec-proc-install>>) and checkout (see <<sec-checkout>>) of the BSL.

==== SELinux Blocked Behavior

TBD

==== FIPS-140 Blocked Behavior

TBD

===== TBD


[#sec-contact]
=== Contacting or Contributing

The BSL is hosted on a GitHub repository <<bsl-source>> with submodule references to several other repositories.
There is a https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/anms/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md[`CONTRIBUTING.md`] document in the BSL repository which describes detailed procedures for submitting tickets to identify defects and suggest enhancements.

Separate from the source for the BSL proper, the BSL Product Guide and User Guide are hosted on a GitHub repository <<bsl-docs>>, with its own https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/anms-docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md[`CONTRIBUTING.md`] document for submitting tickets about either the Product Guide or User Guide.

While the GitHub repositories are the primary means by which users should submit detailed tickets, other inquiries can be made directly via email to the the support address mailto:dtnma-support@jhuapl.edu[,BSL Support].
